<p class="drop-capy">IT is to you I dedicate this Treatise,
and beg your protection
of the same, hoping it will meet
with a kind reception.</p>

<p>The approbation men of character
and sense have given the
following Work, has made me
venture it into your hands: And
I hope in the perusal you will
keep in view the Author, I am certain
you cannot then fail of making
great allowances. I am a <em>North-Briton</em>!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
And when you know
that, it alone may be judged by
some, sufficient to brand me with
the hateful name of <em>Tory</em>, and
thereby condemn this Dissuasion.
But let me inform you (for there is
no general rule without an exception)
that I am a most sincere well-wisher
to the common cause of
<em>Liberty</em>, both <em>personal</em> and <em>constitutional</em>;
then you will, give me
a place in the list of your staunch
Friends, and accept of this Attempt,
as intended to be a mean
of abolishing one great part of
<em>Slavery</em> here.</p>

<p>If there is any merit in endeavouring
to set free from <em>Bondage</em>
our fellow creatures, and in trying
to promote the good and welfare
of any nation, province, country,
or individual, surely I may claim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
it; for my sincere endeavour is
to these purposes: And if I should
happen to miss my aim, I shall
sit down satisfied with the merit
of a good intent.</p>

<p>Readers, I have but one favour
to ask of you, which is, to peruse this
Performance with an open unbiassed
mind; overlooking any defects
you may observe in these
sheets, knowing they are the hasty
and undigested thoughts of the
Author, put together with more
good intent than ability; after this
you may either reject or practise, according
to your own consciences,
and the light of this Treatise, if there
is any to be found in it. <em>Enslaving</em>
your fellow men, and using and
massacring them as they do in the
<em>West-Indies</em> and Southern Provinces,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
is a matter of too great importance
to be only slightly thought of.
And as I hope you have the <em>humanity</em>
of <em>Britons</em>, and that <em>love of Liberty</em>,
with which every true <em>Englishman</em>
is, or ought to be possessed
of, you will not countenance it,
but declare yourselves as I do,
<em>well-wishers of the British Empire,
and consequently enemies to</em> Slavery.</p>

<p>Accept then, Friends and Brethren
in one common cause, this
small token of that love and veneration
which I bear to freedom,
(for no country can be called free
where there is one Slave) and
give me leave to subscribe myself,</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="fs50 lsp3">THE</span><br />
<span class="lsp2a">PREFACE.</span></h2>

<hr class="fulla" />

<p class="p2 drop-capy">I had not well arrived in
<em>America</em>, when casting my
eyes on so many Black Slaves, I
immediately found a warm inclination
arise in my breast, to do
my endeavours for relieving them
by publishing to the world my
sentiments upon their state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span></p>

<p>Scarce had I time to draw a
breath of this air, before I immediately
applied myself to enquire
into the state of this <em>Slavery</em>, and
the constitution upon which it is
founded, and having met with
proper preliminaries by way of
foundation for a small Treatise, I
set myself to work in forming, and
in short finished this Pamphlet.</p>

<p>From the consideration of the
smallness of this production, and
my inability to treat the subject
properly, I was nigh resolving not
to prefix my name hereto: But
thinking again, some opposite party
might take hold of that, I
thought it most proper to shew
my common signature, knowing
the cause I defend is good and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
well founded.</p>

<p>Some will no doubt be surprised
that I have wrote this Dissuasion
after the form of a Sermon: It is
easily accounted for. A Sermon
being <em>a discourse of instruction pronounced
by a Divine for the edification
of the people</em>. I am no Divine
nor ever expect to be; but I hope
that is no reason why these sheets
should not be of publick benefit,
as my design was for that end;
I chose to write it in this form, as
being the truest way to display
with perspicuity and plainness the
unlawfulness, <em>&amp;c.</em> of the Slave
Trade, for which purpose I have
attempted it in different heads
and branches, in some of which
are contained many pertinent remarks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
or observations on this inhuman
Commerce; and I thought
further, it was the easiest method
for myself, and plainest for my
Readers; it being intended for the
weakest and highest capacities.</p>

<p>It may be objected by some, that
the writings on this subject are too
numerous already. I answer, that
however many there may be extant,
(although I could find but very
few) yet there are none so full as
not to admit of amendments or
improvements: If so, and that
these may not altogether be
of inconsiderable use to mankind,
why may not I make them?
and why may they not be transmitted
to mankind?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span></p>

<p>A Treatise of this kind may
not be unnecessary, notwithstanding
many Books, Pamphlets,
and Letters have been published
on the subject.</p>

<p>But however ineffectual this
Treatise may prove hereafter among
men, this I comfort myself
with, it is as full, considering the
largeness, as any upon the subject
which I have seen; and there
are few arguments that possibly
could be advanced, or citations
drawn from Scripture concerning
man-selling, <em>&amp;c.</em> that have escaped,
in trying to wean men from this
base and inhuman trade. And in
fine, if this Work meets with encouragement
equal to the Author’s
care and endeavours to make it
the most useful of the kind, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
having the desired effect he shall
esteem himself sufficiently rewarded.</p>

<p>With regard to the Dissuasion,
I leave the Reader to judge, after
having read it over cooly and impartially,
whether it ought to be
approved or disapproved; if the
former, it will no doubt meet with
his protection in publick. But
I have something to ask, which I
beg may not be refused, and that
is, if you have not a fund of patience
laid up in store, before you
begin to peruse it, you are requested
to lay it aside, until you have.</p>

<p>There is one small part of it
taken from <em>Postlethwayt</em>’s Dictionary
of Commerce. Another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
part from <em>A. Benezett</em>’s Caution
to <em>Great-Britain</em> and her Colonies,
both which Authors I am very
glad were born before me, they
having assisted me so far. And
with regard to the remaining part,
I can tell where it came from.</p>

<p>As it is necessary in order to
bring about a change in any, particularly
a publick affair, to touch
the minds of the people with a
just and true sense of the unlawfulness
of the thing wanted to be
removed, that to the end they
may be unanimous in the abolishment
thereof; this Dissuasion
I am convinced you will find
upon perusal, is calculated for
that purpose, and am very sensible,
that it alone never can strike<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
the great blow without the legislative
force added to it.</p>

<p>I will detain you no longer;
indeed I have almost run into an
Introduction amidst this Preface:
But it could not well be otherwise,
the connexion between
them was so great, and had I separated
them, I <ins class="corr" id="tn-xvi" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'shonld have incurred'">should have incurred</ins>
your displeasure, by increasing
the Prolegomenas to a
degree larger than the Dissuasion
itself.</p>

<p class="p2 drop-capy">THE subject of which these few
sheets treat, would have been one
of the last I should have ventured upon;
had not the delusion of the men who are
concerned in enslaving the people called
<em>Negroes</em> appeared so glaring, and the contradiction
that the <em>Slave Trade</em> bears to
Christianity, prompted me to it.</p>

<p>I shall be as cool and impartial in
treating of this matter, as any British
subject or Christian can: But why do
I say cool? It is impossible I should
speak cooly of such <ins class="corr" id="tn-17" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'base, unchristan'">
base, unchristian</ins>, and
inhuman practices, in a land of Liberty
and Christianity: However, in case any
thing should be mentioned in the sequel
that may give unintended offence to any
person, I hope the tender feelings for
these distressed Captives, with which I
am possessed, and the warmth that is in
my breast, to have this Trade abolished,
will be sufficient excuse.</p>

<p>I propose dividing the following Treatise
into these different heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>I. Shew, that this custom of making
Slaves of our fellow-men, is expressly
against the revealed laws of God.</p>

<p>II. That it is likewise against the law
of nature, and the Charter of this
Province.</p>

<p>III. The disadvantages arising from
this base Trade.</p>

<p>IV. The advantages arising from
abolishing it. And,</p>

<p>V. Conclude with a short admonition
to those concerned, and a method
to put the Trade to <em>Africa</em> on a just
and lawful footing.</p>

<p>The first head was, That the custom
of making Slaves of our fellow creatures,
is expressly against the revealed laws of
<span class="smcap">God</span>. And in treating of this part, I
shall divide it into the following branches.
1st. By the laws of <span class="smcap">God</span>, <em>He that stealeth
and selleth a man, shall be put to death</em>.
2d. <em>He in whose hands he shall be found,
shall be put to death</em>, by the same laws.
3d. <em>He that buyeth a Servant and serveth
him six years, shall set him free the seventh,
and furnish him liberally with what
he hath.</em> And 4th. <em>If thy Brother</em>,
that is, your fellow-creature, <em>be sold
unto thee, thou shall not compel him to serve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
as a Bond-man; but as an hired Servant</em>.</p>

<p>The first branch under this head is,
<em>He that stealeth and selleth a man, shall
be put to death</em>. This is one of the
most express laws of <em>Moses</em>, as you may
see in <em>Exod.</em> xxi. 16, two first, and last
clauses of the verse, there mentioned in
the most peremptory words; <em>And he
that stealeth a man, and selleth him, shall
surely be put to death.</em> It certainly can
be looked upon in no other light in the
Merchants and Ship-masters who are in
this Trade to <em>Africa</em>, than stealing of
men, being accessary to, and aiding in
inciting them to war one with another,
and for this purpose, supplying them
with prodigious quantities of arms and
ammunition, whereby they are hurried into
confusion, bloodshed, and all the extremities
of temporal misery, which
must consequently beget in their minds
such a general detestation and scorn of
the Christian name, as may deeply affect,
if not wholly preclude, their belief of
the great truths of our holy religion.
Thus an insatiable desire of gain prevails
with their Kings, who, instead of being
protectors of their people, for this alluring
bait laid before them, by the <em>European</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
and <em>American</em> Factors, or Ship-masters,
invade the Liberties of these unhappy
people, and occasion <ins class="corr" id="tn-20" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'their opression'">
their oppression</ins>. These Kings, whenever they want goods
send to the Ship-masters, acquainting
them they have Negroes, and sometimes
the Factors and Ship-masters send to acquaint
them, that they have a quantity
of goods, and want Slaves for the
same. These Chiefs, whether they have
Slaves then or not, agree, and immediately
go to war with their neighbours,
and in procuring three or four hundred
prisoners, burn five or six towns, as
appears by the following extract from a
Surgeon’s Journal in a <em>Liverpool</em> vessel.</p>

<p class="p1 right"><em>Sestro, December 29, 1724.</em></p>

<p>“No trade to-day, though many
Traders came on board; they inform
us, that the people are gone to war
within land, and will bring prisoners
enough in two or three days;
in hopes of which we stay.</p>

<p>“30th. No trade yet; but our Traders
came on board to-day and informed us
the people had burnt four towns, so
that to-morrow we expect Slaves off.</p>

<p>“31st. Fair weather, but no trade yet;
we see each night towns burning, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
we hear the <em>Sestro</em> men are many of them
killed by the inland Negroes, so that
we fear this war will be unsuccessful.</p>

<p>“The 2d of <em>January</em>. Last night
we saw a prodigious fire break out
about eleven o’clock, and this morning
saw the town of <em>Sestro</em> burnt down
to the ground, (it contained some
hundred houses) so that we find their
enemies are too hard for them at present;
consequently our trade spoiled
here, so that about seven o’clock we
weighed anchor, as did also the three
other vessels, to proceed lower down.”</p>

<p>Here follows another relation taken
from an original Journal of a Surgeon
who sailed out of <em>New-York</em>, “Being
on the Coast of <em>Guinea</em> at a place
called <em>Basalia</em>, the Commander of the
vessel, according to custom, sent a
person on shore, with a present to the
King, acquainting him with his
arrival, and informing him they
wanted a cargo of Slaves. The
King promised to furnish them, and
in order to do it, set out to war
against his enemies; designing also
to surprise some town, and take all
the people prisoners: Some time after,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
the King sent them word, he had
not yet met with the desired success,
having been twice repulsed in attempting
to break up two towns;
but that he still hoped to procure a
number of Slaves for them, and in
this design persisted, until he met his
enemies in the field, where a battle was
fought, which lasted three days, during
which time, the engagement was
so bloody that four thousand five hundred
men were slain on the spot. Think
(says he) what a pitiful sight it was
to see the Widows weeping over their
lost Husbands, Orphans deploring the
loss of their Fathers, <em>&amp;c.</em>” Oh! shocking
spectacles! to see four or five towns
burnt, and four thousand five hundred
people killed, for the sake of taking three
or four hundred, and you! you! Merchants,
Ship-masters and Factors the cause
of it all! Think you ever to get the crime
of spilling so much blood repented of?</p>

<p>It is a known custom among the Factors
who reside in <em>Africa</em>, and the Ship-masters
who trade there, to corrupt
many Negroes on the sea coast, who
stop at no act of cruelty for gain. They
make it a practice, to steal abundance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
little Blacks of both sexes, when found
on the roads, or in the fields, where
their Parents keep them all day to watch
the corn, <em>&amp;c.</em> Can it be denied that the
<em>Africans</em> are <em>stolen</em> after so many proofs of
it, and if it is not direct stealth in the Ship-masters,
<em>&amp;c.</em> yet it is the same in effect;
for if they did not go there and entice
the Chiefs with money or goods,
there would be no wars, as is the case at
present; and there would be none stolen
if the stealers were not bribed by the Factors
or Ship-masters; and not only those
that are made Slaves of, there would still
be ten thousand others who are killed in
the broils, that would be saved, were they
to discontinue this base Trade.</p>

<p>Thus far I have shewn that they are
stolen. They may say they pay for them.
I answer, they give money or goods by
way of price to some of the Princes and
Negroes, who, for the sake of lucre,
take them prisoners by war or stealth, so
that what money they give these scoundrels,
(forgive me the expression; for,
what name can a man expect who would
take his Father or Brother and sell then
for gain?) who take them in these ways<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
cannot be looked upon as a price paid in
lieu, for the Negroes themselves never
condescend to be mancipated, as they
get none of the money that is pretendedly
given for them. They at length
arrive at the port, the Ship-master sell
them at a most exorbitant profit, and in
a few voyages he makes what he calls his
fortune; this is all he aimed at and
wished for; and what follows, secures
his eternal destruction, unless timely repented
of: For the truth of this, I could
mention very striking instances of men,
who I see almost every day; but I do
not chuse mentioning names, for fear of
seeing them contemned and despised by
every well thinking person.</p>

<p>I need add no more on this branch, it
being clear that they are stolen in every
sense it can be taken; they, the Ship-masters,
<em>&amp;c.</em> being the sole cause of the
many wars and broils that are amongst
the Negro Princes and Chiefs, consequently
the cause of these poor creatures
being taken and made Slaves of, and of
the many thousands that are killed in the
wars: Besides, it is not, nor can be
denied that they sell them, so that they
who practise this branch of Man-stealing
and selling can expect nothing but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
the penalties of <span class="smcap">God</span>’s laws, which he,
in his own time, will inflict, since man!
indolent man! will not punish them with
death, as warranted sufficiently by the
above cited passage in holy writ.</p>

<p>Before I leave this branch it may
not be improper to give my Readers a
short sketch of the barbarous usage these
unhappy people meet with from the
Ship-masters in their passage from <em>Africa</em>.
After they have got them on board
shackled two and two together, they keep
them confined below all the passage, never
permitting more than two on deck at
a time to take one breath of fresh air,
the most common blessing we enjoy,
conscious that they are doing wrong to
these people, and not certain but <span class="smcap">God</span>
might raise them against the Ship-master
and his crew, if they had the least opportunity
to stir up an insurrection in the
ship, to retrieve their Liberty which
they had in their own country, and which
they ought to enjoy by the laws of <span class="smcap">God</span>,
of <em>Britain</em>, and the Plantations.</p>

<p>For the Reader’s true satisfaction as to
this inhuman and unchristian usage,
which could be expected of no other
than Barbarians, I shall here narrate some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
accounts which have been given by men
<ins class="corr" id="tn-26" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'concerned ni the'">
concerned in the</ins> Slave Trade.</p>

<p>First, the following case is mentioned
in <cite>Astley</cite>’s Collection of Voyages, by
<cite>John Atkins</cite>, Surgeon on board Admiral
<em>Ogle</em>’s squadron, “Of one <em>Harding</em>, Master
of a vessel, in which several of the
Men-slaves and a Woman-slave had
attempted to rise in order to recover
their Liberty; some of whom the
Master of his own authority sentenced
to cruel deaths, making them first eat
the hearts and liver of one of those he
killed. The woman he hoisted by
the thumbs, whiped, and slashed with
knives before other Slaves, until she
died.” Oh unparralelled cruelty!</p>

<p>Next is an account given by a Ship-master
who brought a Cargo of Slaves
to <em>Barbadoes</em>, upon an enquiry what had
been the success of the voyage, he answered,
“That he had found it a difficult
matter to set the Negroes a fighting
with each other in order to procure
the number he wanted.” This shews,
Reader, what methods they practise to
obtain these Slaves, <em>by setting them a fighting
with each other</em>. “But when he had
obtained his end, having filled his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
vessel with Slaves, a new difficulty arose
from their refusal to take food: Those
desperate creatures chusing rather to
die with hunger than to be carried from
their native country.” Upon a further
enquiry how he got them to forego this
desperate resolution, he answered, “That
he obliged all the Negroes to come on
deck, where they persisting in their
resolution of not taking food, he caused
his sailors to lay hold on one of the
most obstinate, who chopped the poor
creature into small pieces, forcing some
of the others to eat a part of the mangled
body; swearing to the survivors,
that he would use them all one after
the other in the same manner if they
did not consent to eat.” This horrid
execution he applauded as a good act,
it having had the desired effect in causing
them to take food.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" id="tn-27" title="Transcriber’s Note—This paragraph was in quotation marks in the original text">
As detestable</ins> and shocking as these
usages to the poor Negroes may appear to
such whose hearts are not yet hardened
by the practise of that cruelty which the
love of wealth by degrees introduceth into
the human mind, it will not be strange
to those who have been concerned or employed
in the Trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>The second branch was, <em>If he be found
in his hands, he surely shall be put to
death</em>. This is the third and fourth
clause of the before cited verse in <em>Exod.</em>
<em>If he be found in his hands</em>. This is to be
understood in two senses, either found
in the Ship-master’s hands who stole
him, or bought, as he says, or in the person’s
hands who purchases him. As to
the first of these senses in which this
passage may be taken, if the laws of
<span class="smcap">God</span>, yea, even of man, were to be put
into execution, he, the stealer, or even
the buyer, would be punished with
death, for it is clear as to Man-stealing, that
it deserves death, by the above passage
of Scripture, and it is no less with regard
to buying: But why do I say buying?
For no money can be equal to the worth
of a man: Buying, I admit that word
because Ship-masters and others in this
Trade, say, for their justification that
they purchased the Negroes, but as there
are no laws, either of <span class="smcap">God</span> or man, for
the buying and stealing of <em>Africans</em>, I
am inclined to think it cannot be supposed,
but they justly deserve death. And in
the second sense, the man who buys the
<em>Africans</em> or Negroes is full as culpable
as the stealer, and liable to the same
punishment, for Scripture does not point<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
out particularly either of them, but only
just, <em>If he be found in his hands</em>, that is,
in any man’s hands, so that it can be
proved he stole or bought him, <em>he surely
shall be put to death</em>.</p>

<p>The third part was, <em>He that buyeth a
Servant and serveth him six years, shall set
him free the seventh, and furnish him liberally
with what he hath</em>. The first part of
this branch is proved in three different
texts, <em>viz.</em> <em>Exod.</em> xxi. 2. <em>Deut.</em> xv. 12. and
<em>Jer.</em> xxxiv. 14. In all which parts it
is expressly mentioned, <em>That if an</em> Hebrew
<em>Servant be sold unto thee</em>, or if you
buy him he <em>shall serve thee six years, and
the seventh, thou shall let him go free from
thee</em>, that is, he shall pay nothing for
his Liberty.</p>

<p>Some persons for argument sake may
object to this, saying, these people are
not <em>Hebrews</em>, as mentioned in these texts
of Scripture, but <em>Heathens</em>. This may be
difficult enough to determine. However,
admit they are <em>Heathens</em>, (although
it is well known they are not) it must be
owned by those who know them, that
the natives of <em>Africa</em> have exalted notions
of a Deity. It is an odd method these
Traders take to civilize and teach them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
the Christian religion, by importing one
hundred thousand of them yearly into
<em>Virginia</em> and other Southern Provinces, together
with the <em>West-India</em> islands, where
they are kept in greater darkness than
before, as they are not allowed to worship
<span class="smcap">God</span> on the Sabbath; but are employed
in worldly business on that day,
which is a scandal to the Rulers of the
<em>British</em> Colonies and Islands where such
things are practised. It is subversive of
the Christian religion not to allow those
ignorant people the benefit of it, who
make up more than two thirds of the
inhabitants of the beforementioned places.
It is expressly against the laws of
<span class="smcap">God</span>; for he gave <em>Paul</em> and other Apostles
commission to go and preach the gospel
to every nation, kindred, and tongue;
but instead of that, where the gospel is
preached throughout the <em>British</em> Colonies,
and where these people might expect to
receive the light of it; I say, instead of
that, they are kept from divine worship
on Sundays, and never once in their
lifetime admitted to church, but obliged
to cultivate their small piece of ground
allowed them by their Masters.</p>

<p>The last part of the verse runs thus,
<em>And shall furnish him liberally with what he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
hath.</em> That is, when the Servant hath
served thee six years, as expressed in
<em>Exod.</em> xxi. 2, and <em>Deut.</em> xv. 12. <em>Then
in the seventh year you shall let him go free
from you</em>; and in ver. 13. <em>Thou shall not
let him go away empty.</em> Ver. 14. <em>Thou shall
furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and
out of thy floor, and out of thy wine press;
of that wherewith the</em> <span class="smcap">Lord</span> <em>thy</em> <span class="smcap">God</span>
<em>hath blessed thee, thou shalt give him. This
is in token that thou dost acknowledge the
benefit that thou hast received by his labours.</em>
Marg. Bible.</p>

<p>It is still further required to set your
Servants or Bond-men free at the above
appointed time, by the 15th verse of the
same chap. <em>And thou shalt remember that
thou wast a Bond-man in the</em> <ins class="corr" id="tn-31" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'land of Egygt'">
<em>land of</em> Egypt</ins>,
<em>and the</em> <span class="smcap">Lord</span> <em>thy</em> <span class="smcap">God</span> <em>redeemed thee;
therefore I command thee this thing to-day.
I command thee.</em> You are ordered, yea,
commanded to do <em>this thing</em>. What thing?
To set free your Bond-servants after six
years service. You are commanded to
do it <em>to-day</em>, <em>viz.</em> At the expiration of
six years, for, says <span class="smcap">God</span>, by the voice of his
Servant, <em>I command thee this thing to-day</em>.</p>

<p>There is a blessing promised to those
who do this thing in ver. 18 of the above
chap. After enjoining that it may not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
seem hard unto you in sending away this
Servant, as he hath been worth a double
hired one, in serving thee six years,
he says, <em>and the</em> <span class="smcap">Lord</span> <em>thy</em> <span class="smcap">God</span> <em>shall bless
thee in all that thou doest</em>. Sweet encouragement
for poor sinful souls! To be
blessed in every thing that they do. What
man will forfeit this great blessing for the
sake of the service of one, two, or more
Servants for life? Will he allow himself
to be cursed by <span class="smcap">God</span> in every thing that
he doeth for the small gain he can make
by their services? This charming promise
of a blessing in all that thou doest,
and the dreadful events that may take
place in contradicting the command of
<span class="smcap">God</span>, I hope will make such impressions
upon the minds of men, that they will not
bind Servant to serve above six years;
but will set him at liberty in the seventh
year, and give him liberally of what the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath blessed them with, as required
in the above cited text. If you think
you have not enough of this, pass along to</p>

<p>The fourth and last section on this
head, <em>If thy Brother be sold unto thee, thou
shall not compel him to serve as a Bond-man;
but as an hired Servant</em>. This is proved by
<em>Lev.</em> xxv. 39, 40. where it is said, <em>If thy
Brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
and be sold unto thee, thou shalt not compel
him to serve as a Bond-servant.</em> This is
expressly against making Slaves of any
of our poor Brethren, or compeling them
to serve as Bond-servants. <em>If thy Brother
that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor</em>, are
the words of the verse; the poor <em>Africans</em>
who fall into the hands of the Men-wolves
that prowl on their coasts, are obliged
to serve their lifetime, and their children
after them: This is being Bond-men
with a witness, and as we have great reason
to believe they are poor enough when
they steal them, they are kept so forever
after, not having means to make a penny
themselves. The <em>Africans</em> will be understood,
if not primarily intended, to be the people
mentioned in this text! It is said, <em>Thy Brother
who dwelleth by thee</em>: When they are in <em>Africa</em>
it is certain they are at a great distance;
but when they come to <em>America</em> or the <em>West-Indies</em>
they then dwell <em>by us</em>; therefore I think,
from the above citations, no person can buy
these people, and oblige them and their
children to serve as Slaves, without incuring
the displeasure of <span class="smcap">God</span> and his punishments
for disobeying his just commands.</p>

<p>It may be added, as in v. 42d of the same
chap. <em>For they are my servants, which I brought
forth</em> <ins class="corr" id="tn-34" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'out of Eygpt'">
<em>out of</em> Egypt</ins>; <em>they shall not be sold as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
Bond-men</em>. The last part of this verse is expressly
against <em>selling</em> them as Bond-men.
Should it be objected, that the <em>Africans</em>
were not <em>brought forth out of the land of</em> Egypt,
it would not affect the controversy. I would
sincerely advise every man who is in this
abominable Trade not to persist in it,
seeing the many threats and commands
against him in <span class="smcap">God</span>’s laws, and the blessings
that are promised if he does not.</p>

<p>The IId General Head proposed, is,
That this practice of making Slaves of our
Brethren is likewise against the law of
nature, and the Charter of this Province.
The first part of this head, may be easily
proved by the following texts of Scripture;
<em>Matt.</em> vii. 12. <em>Therefore all things
whatsoever ye would that men should do to
you, do ye even so to them.</em> <em>Luke</em> vi. 31.
<em>And as you would that men should do to you,
do ye so to them likewise.</em> Who is that proud
one that will not receive these instructions?
And who is that man that will do unto any
person, either white or black, Christian or
Savage, contrary to what he would that he
should do to him? This would be acting
contrary to reason and common sense. Would
any person consent to have himself torn
from his friends and native country, and be
made a Slave for life, and to have his dear,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
dear little children continue in the same
condition from one generation to another?
No; surely no person would agree to that.
Well then, it certainly must be contrary to
the laws of nature, christianity, and subversive
of the texts just quoted, which were
wrote for our direction and guidance in this
world. It is likewise certain, that those
who carry on this Trade, do not unto
men as they would men should do to
them; for if these poor people which they,
the Ship-masters take from their own Country
and then sell for Slaves, were doing
to them as they are done to, they would (were
it in their power, which seldom is the case,
the owners being conscious of the wrong
they are doing, and dreading what naturally
would follow) revenge the injury they receive
in being made Slaves, and resume that
Liberty again, which was wrongfully
taken from them; I say, they would
often revenge the injury offered them by
killing the Captain of the ship who had taken
them to be mancipated for life, and would
serve in the same manner the Owners of the
vessel if they could get them, who are
no better than the Masters, in putting them
into such employ. Who could find fault
with them? No person. They were only
retrieving the most common blessing we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
enjoy, Liberty, and instead of being
punished, the law would protect them in
so noble an action. But,</p>

<p>Readers, before I leave this, let me
beg you to “bring the matter home to yourselves,
and think whether any condition
in life can be more completely miserable
than that of those distressed Captives. On
reflecting, that each of them had some tender
attachments which were broke by the
cruel separation! Some Parent or Wife who
had not an opportunity of mingling tears
in a parting embrace! Perhaps some Infant
or aged Parent whom his labour was
to feed, and vigilance protect! and himself
under the dreadful apprehensions of
perpetual Slavery.”</p>

<p>To inforce this part of the head, allow
me, Reader, to intrude a little upon your
time, by giving you a short account of the
barbarous usage these poor Negroes meet
with from their Masters in the <em>West-Indies</em>
and Southern Provinces of <em>North-America</em>;
on reading of which, you will not be long
in concluding, that they do not in this case
observe the golden rule.</p>

<p>The crimes attending the Slave Trade are
greatly aggravated by the extreme cruel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
usage the Negroes meet with in the Plantations,
as well with regard to food and cloathing
as the hard and unreasonable
labour that is exacted from them, and what
cannot be forgot, the severe chastisements
they frequently suffer, which is bounded
by the wrath and pleasure of their hard
task-masters. 1st. As to their food. In <em>Barbadoes,
&amp;c.</em><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> “three quarts of corn and three
herrings are a weeks allowance for a working
Slave; and it is mentioned in the System
of Geography, that in <em>Jamaica</em> the Owners
of the Negro Slaves set aside for each, a piece
of ground, and allow them Sundays to cultivate
it, the produce of which with a few
salt herrings or other salt fish is all that is
allowed for their support. But need I
go so far as <em>Jamaica</em> to prove this? No. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
<em>Virginia</em> they do the same. 2d. As to their
cloathing. In the Islands, the allowance for
a Slave’s cloathing is seldom more than six
yards of oznabrigs a year, and in the
Southern Colonies, where the piercing
westerly winds are long and sensibly felt,
these poor <em>Africans</em> suffer much for the
want of sufficient cloathing; indeed, shocking
to relate! some of them are obliged to
work most of the night in boiling-houses,
notwithstanding the hard days work they
have performed. Their Owners make great
gain by their Slaves’ labour. They lay
heavy burdens on them, and yet feed and
cloath them very sparingly, and some scarcely
at all; so that it cannot be wondered that
these poor creatures are obliged to shift for
their living as they do, which occasions many
of them being killed in stealing potatoes
or other food to satisfy hunger. If they are
detected in taking any thing from the plantation
they belong to, which they have so
hardly laboured for, they are cruely whiped.”
Lastly. With respect to the beating
which these poor people meet with in the
<em>West-Indies</em>. For the least fault they whip
them most unmercifully, <em>viz.</em> for not being
at work in half an hour after the usual
notice; speaking a word which the Overseer
may think saucy; not shewing respect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
enough to him; not doing with agility
some hard piece of work ordered them;
and any thing which the Overseer may take
exception at. They beat them with thick
clubs, and you may see their bodies all whaled
in a terrible manner.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>George Whitefield</em> writes in a letter to
the Planters in <em>Virginia</em>, <em>Carolina</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em> “The
task-masters, by their inhuman usage and
unrelenting scourges have ploughed their
backs and made long furrows, and at length
brought them even to death.” This is the
fate which great numbers in the islands and
Southern Provinces meet with. When speaking
of their cloathing and food, he adds,
“When passing along, I have viewed your
plantations cleared and cultivated, many
spacious houses built, and the Owners
of them faring sumptuously every day.
My blood has frequently run cold within
me to consider how many of your Slaves
had neither convenient food to eat or
proper raiment to put on, notwithstanding
many of the comforts you enjoy were
solely owing to their indefatigable labours.”
In <em>Virginia</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em> in case a Negro
gives the slightest affront to a white
person, he goes to the Negroe’s Master
and demands satisfaction, the Master delivers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
him to the white person to take what
satisfaction he pleases; who whips him,
strikes him with clubs, and, as is often done,
cuts off his ears, <ins class="corr" id="tn-40" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'and mark him'">
and marks him</ins> by cuting
his face, or other parts of his body. What
more could be done to a brute beast, who
was brought up and designed for the yoke?
Oh! how long will you continue in this
delusion and horrid abuse of the principal
workmanship of <span class="smcap">God</span>. It is astonishing
how a people who so much
value themselves upon their Freedom can
continue in the practice of so much oppression.
Will not the groans of this afflicted and
miserable people reach Heaven! And when
the cup of inequity is filled, the unavoidable
tendency must be the pouring forth of
<span class="smcap">God</span>’s judgments upon their oppressors.
But alas! is it not too plain that this cruelty
has already been the object of divine
anger? For what greater judgment can
befal any person than to become a prey
to that obduracy of heart, that neglectfulness
of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and a callousness to every religious
impression?</p>

<p>I could say a great deal more concerning
the unparralleled cruelty that these
Negroes meet with: But I apprehend more
has been said already than will be believed,
although it is far from coming up to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
real truth; for it is impossible my pen can
represent in proper colours the hard usage
they meet with. The sympathizing Reader
must feel the rest, for I can assist him no
farther. I believe there are but few that
have not heard or read of the cruel treatment
of those unhappy mortals. Indeed it
is almost incredible that such cruelty should
be practised in any of the <em>British</em> dominions.</p>

<p>I could have quoted a dozen Authors,
setting forth the inhuman punishments
inflicted upon the <em>Africans</em>; but that
would have swelled my page. I hope this
short, but true narrative, for great part of
which I am much obliged to Mr. <em>Benezet</em>,
will answer the same end of raising in every
breast an utter detestation and abhorrence
of the horrid customs and savage
usage in the Islands and Colonies abovementioned,
and I make no doubt but every one
will clearly see, <em>they do not to these Negroes
as they would that they should do to them</em>.</p>

<p>I think it is time to leave this part and
go to the last, <em>viz.</em> That this base custom
is likewise against the Charter of this Province;
as is clearly and most simply demonstrated
by a clause in said Charter, granted
by King <em>William</em> and Queen <em>Mary</em>, dated
at <em>Westminster</em>, the 7th of <em>October</em>, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
third year of their reign, wherein, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</i>,
it is established and ordained, <em>That all and
every of the Subjects of Us, our Heirs, and Successors,
which shall go to and inhabit within Our
said Province and territory, and every of their
Children which shall happen to be born there, or
on the seas in going thither, or returning from
thence, shall have and enjoy all</em> Liberties <em>and
immunities of</em> <span class="allsmcap">FREE</span> <em>and natural Subjects within
the dominions of Us, Our Heirs, and Successors,
to all intents, constructions, and purposes
whatsoever, as if they and every of them
were born within our realm of</em> England. I
need say but little as to this branch of the
head further than to observe, that the clause
of the Charter just cited, proves clearly, and
which cannot be further disputed, <em>that all
and every of the Subjects, the Inhabitants of</em>
New-England, <em>which shall come to and inhabit
within the Province and territory of the
same, and every of their Children which shall
happen to be born there, shall have and enjoy
all the</em> Liberties, &amp;c. <em>of</em> <span class="allsmcap">FREE</span> <em>and natural Subjects
of the realm of</em> England. Indeed I am
sorry to mention that this Charter should have
been so long subverted and remained unobserved
by the Publick in so interesting a
point, when by timely observance it might
have saved many thousands from Slavery
that are now dead and mouldered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
into dust. I hope this easy found light will
not be too late discovered to direct and save
the present Slaves from their Bondage,
which many! too many! groan under: So
that I expect the inhabitants of the <em>American</em>
Provinces will not give any person an
opportunity of charging them with that infamous
character of making or keeping any
man or woman Slaves, when they are complaining
daily that their Liberties are wrested
from them, and little think how they
deprive these poor Black People of their Freedom,
when there is as little reason for
it as there is for making Slaves of <em>British</em>
Subjects. The above cited clause in the
Charter, says, <em>Those born in or shall come to
and dwell within the Province of the</em> Massachusetts-Bay
are <span class="allsmcap">FREE</span>; from which I am led
to think, and which every person must see,
will extend to Black as well as White.
But, Reader, excuse me, whoever you are,
that may take offence at my construing this
clause of the Charter in the manner I have
done, it is only my opinion, and every one is at
liberty to enjoy his own sentiments upon it as
well as I; therefore I flatter myself of hearing
soon, that means will be taken by the
Legislature of most, if not all the Provinces
of <em>North-America</em>, and the <em>West-India</em> Islands,
totally prohibiting the importation of Negroes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
into the <em>British</em> Plantations; and setting
at Liberty with universal consent, every Negro
throughout the whole, at least in <em>North-America</em>,
which will be an honour to human
nature, to say that this great and
this only remaining hinderance to the absolute
freedom as well as legality of the <em>English</em>
trade is now happily and gloriously abolished;
and then we may all cry with shouts
of joy! which few more countries in the
four quarters of the globe can, <em>That complete</em>
<span class="allsmcap">FREEDOM</span> <em>both in people and trade is allowed
throughout the</em> British <em>Islands and Plantations
in</em> America <em>and</em> the West-Indies!</p>

<p>The IIId General Head proposed was,
To shew the disadvantages arising from
this base Trade. This head I propose to
consider separately, and shall 1st. Shew the
disadvantages to <em>Africa</em> in taking so many
of its natives away yearly. 2d. Treat of the
hurt and prejudice of this Trade with <em>Europe</em>.
3d. Shew the disadvantages to the
<em>British</em> Plantations in <em>America</em>, particularly
to the <em>West-Indies</em>, in carrying Black People
thither.</p>

<p>The first part of this head is, To shew the
disadvantages to <em>Africa</em> in taking so many
of its natives yearly. Before I enter upon
this branch it may not be improper to mention
a few observations which Mr. <em>Postlethwayt</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
makes upon the great qualities
which this country abound with. “Its
situation for commerce is certainly beyond
any of the other quarters of the
world, for it stands in the center between
the other three, and has thereby a
much nearer communication with <em>Europe</em>,
<em>Asia</em>, and <em>America</em>, than any other quarter
has with the rest. It is wonderfully accommodated
for commerce <ins class="corr" id="tn-45" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'by the interposion'">
by the interposition</ins>
of islands, and more particularly by the
assistance of the trade winds, which render
the navigation safe, easy, and constant.
It is furnished with the greatest and most
convenient navigable rivers, and perhaps
with as many of them as any other of the
chief parts of the world: Such are the
<em>Nile</em>, <em>Nubia</em>, <em>Niger</em>, <em>Natal</em>, which are rivers
of the first magnitude; besides these
there are innumerable others, though not
equal to the former, are yet very excellent
streams, situated for navigation and commerce,
and which by their noble courses
penetrate far inland; if the <em>Europeans,
&amp;c.</em> would cultivate a human and Christian
like commerce with the <em>Africans</em>, they
might through these rivers become the
medium of an endless beneficial commerce.
The country is populous beyond credibility,
the soil fruitful, the season for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
greatest part mild and clement, and the air
salubrious.” I must stop in the midst of
this agreeable description, being afraid of
leading myself into an undue length in this
narrative of the beautious perfection of that
rich and fruitful part of the world.</p>

<p>I shall now consider the disadvantages
to <em>Africa</em> in taking so many of its natives
away yearly. But it is needless to speak much
on this head, as most of my Readers will
perceive the prejudices to <em>Africa</em> in thus draining
it of the inhabitants yearly in the manner
<em>Britain</em> and the Plantations do. I shall
mention a few of them. 1st. There can be
no loss to any country (particularly to one
like <em>Africa</em> that is yet mostly to cultivate)
equal to that of depopulating it. 2d. It
prevents the inland country, where the incessant
broils are carried on, from defending
themselves against the attacks and encroachments
made on their properties by
the Kings and Chiefs, whereby many thousands
of their subjects being taken prisoners,
are sold to the Coasters, they being
nourished and caressed by the <em>Europeans</em>,
particularly by <em>Britain</em> and the Colonies, in
doing so, for the sake of the Slave Trade
to <em>America</em>, and the <em>West-Indies</em>; and
further, in consequence of this depriving
them of defending themselves against these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
base assaults, it prevents them entirely from
cultivating and manuring that fruitful
and rich country, to the degree it is capable
of. 3d. It ever obstructs the civilizing of
those people, and consequently of propagating
amongst them the Christian religion,
and extending the Trade into the bowels
of <em>Africa</em>, which by contrary means might
be easily practicable. 4th. That whilst
the slaving Trade of those people, continue
to be the great object of the powers that
trade there it is to be feared it will ever, as
it does at present spirit up wars and hostilities
amongst the Negro Princes and Chiefs,
for the sake of making captives of each
other for sale. And 5th. The greatest disadvantage
to <em>Africa</em>, by thus draining it of
the inhabitants is, that it prevents them
from cultivating and peopling that great
fertile country, of introducing <em>European</em>
arts and sciences amongst them, and of carrying
on a friendly, civil, and christian Commerce
with them into the heart of their
region.</p>

<p>The second branch alluding to the
third head was, to treat of the prejudice
to <em>Africa</em>, and its trade with <em>Europe</em>. It
is an absolute fact, that these people are
incessently at war with their neighbouring
Princes so that they cannot get their business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
looked into or followed, and consequently
a great hinderance to the manufacturing
such quantities of their country’s
produce of every kind, to send to <em>Europe</em> and
<em>America</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em> as they might do, were this
Slave Trade abolished, and the Rulers in
amity, friendship, and concord, one with
another.</p>

<p>It is further a hurt to the <em>African</em> trade
with <em>Europe</em>, for the Slave Trade has so
gained upon the minds of those men that
traffick to <em>Africa</em>, that they never once
think of the other commodities, at least in
such quantities as <em>Europe</em> might consume
were the attention necessary paid to it by
making this the only object of the traders
notice. I believe it would turn out
much more profitable to keep wholly
to the produce of this country, <em>viz.</em>
gums, ivory, gold and silver dust, <em>&amp;c.</em> and
to resign that base unchristian Trade of
Man-selling.</p>

<p>Lastly, on this head, To shew the disadvantages
to the <em>British</em> Plantations in <em>America</em>,
<em>&amp;c.</em> in bringing Black people into
them. This will be made very easily appear
when you consider, that these numerous
Black People, which are yearly brought
into the southern-most parts of <em>North-America</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
and the <em>West-Indies</em> were very poor at
that time, not having a penny to command,
and never so much as once in their lifetime
had it in their power to make one half
that sum for themselves, so that the different
Provinces in the Continent, and the Islands
in the <em>West-Indies</em> are filled with these necessitous
Black People, and must be put upon the
townships to which they belong, in case
this enslaving them be ever abolished,
which I flatter myself, and I hope not vainly,
will be done in time, and that with effect.
Further, why do they fill their Plantations
with Black People, so unnatural to the
Whites, the Proprietors of the different
Colonies, when it seems no way difficult to
obtain White People to serve free in their
stead? <em>Europe</em> in general affords numbers
of poor and distressed objects for that purpose,
and if these were not overworked, as
the Negroes generally are, they would
make as good Servants for the <em>American</em>
and <em>West-India</em> Plantations as the
Blacks do. And if the <em>Europeans</em> were upon
a level with regard to the price of labour,
in their Colonies, I cannot but think they
would reap great advantage in laying aside
the Slave Trade, and cultivate a friendly
and civilised Commerce with the <em>Africans</em>.
Until this is done it does not seem possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
that the inland trade of that country should
ever be extended to the degree it is capable
of; for while the spirit of <em>Butchery</em> and
making Slaves of each other, is promoted
by the <em>Europeans</em>, <em>Americans</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em> amongst
those people, they will never be able to
travel with safety into the heart of the country,
or to cement such commercial friendship
and alliance with them, as will actually
introduce our arts and manufactures.</p>

<p>The IVth General Head was, To shew
the advantages arising from abolishing this
base custom. This Head I propose dividing
into two parts, 1st. The advantages
to <em>Africa</em>, and 2d. The advantages to
<em>Europe</em> particularly to <em>Britain</em> and the Plantations
in <em>America</em> and the <em>West-Indies</em>.</p>

<p>First to <em>Africa</em>. The advantages that
would arise to it, in abolishing this base
and unchristian-like Commerce are numerous,
some of which may be comprehended
under the following. 1st. The
abolishing this Trade may be a means of
peopling this country, and of cultivating
it in the same manner with any other country
in <em>Europe</em> or <em>Asia</em>, so as to render it capable
of bearing in as great abundance as the
<em>East-Indies</em>, spices of equal quality to those
of <em>Banda</em>, <em>Ternate</em>, and <em>Amboyna</em>; I say, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
like spices might be produced on the rich
and fruitful shores of <em>Melinda</em> on the east
side, or of the slave coast on the west side
of <em>Africa</em>, and that as easy and to as great
advantage, as where they are now raised,
the latitude being the same, and soil not
unlike; and, in short, cinnamon and all
others, the production of <em>East</em> and <em>West-Indies</em>,
by proper management might be raised
here as well as in those parts. 2d. It would
introduce the Christian religion among
them, which is a shame to these nations
who pretend to hold fast the principles
of Christianity, to keep so long hid, and
of consequence, be a means of bringing
among them the more civilized arts and
sciences. 3d. It will recommend the <em>European</em>
dress, and introduce their customs
among the natives, and of course civilize
them like other Christian nations. Lastly.
It will be a means of bringing this
country to as great perfection in trade,
riches, and grandeur, as any in <em>Europe</em>, it
being a much more fertile and plentious
soil for many valuable productions.</p>

<p>Much more could I say upon the numerous
advantages arising to this excellent
country: But let what has been said
suffice, I leave the rest to the Reader’s own
feeling, if he has any for this poor distressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
<em>Africa</em> which groans under a heavy load
of oppression.</p>

<p>The next thing in course is, the advantages
that would arise to <em>Europe</em> in thus
carrying on a Christian-like Commerce with
<em>Africa</em>. This trade even in its present state,
excluding that of the Slaves, is as advantageous
as any that is now followed;
and what will it be when a friendly traffick
is carried on? It is as it were all
profit, the first cost being some things of
<em>European</em>, particularly of <em>British</em> manufactures,
and others generally purchased with
them; for which there is in return, gold,
elephant’s-teeth, wax, gums, cotton-wool,
divers dying-woods, and Slaves: But this
last piece of Commerce, <em>viz.</em> Man-slaving,
I am far from making a part of the <em>British</em>
trade, and I dare say every humane person
will be likeminded. These are articles
which the country abound in, and would
be still cheaper to an immense degree, were
the inland parts settled with their own people;
but instead of that, a hundred thousand
are yearly carried away. <em>Britain</em> pays
but little for the commodities it exports
to <em>Africa</em>, being mostly, as observed before,
its own produce, such as worsted <ins class="corr" id="tn-52" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'and conton cloths'">
and cotton cloths</ins> of all kinds, brass, iron, and copper
work of every sort, particularly large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
quantities of all kinds of defensive arms,
with powder and shot in proportion; <em>East-India</em>
goods, every kind of <em>British</em> manufactures,
and a good deal of <em>American</em> and
<em>West-India</em> rum, <em>&amp;c.</em> It is not easy to say
what vast quantities of the above <em>British</em>
and <em>American</em> productions would be exhausted
yearly among so great a people,
and in so very extensive a country, were the
Slave Trade stopped. It is the interest of
every Merchant in <em>Britain</em> and the Plantations
who are now concerned in traffick to <em>Africa</em>,
to cultivate the inland commerce in its
utmost extent, as having no manner of concern
with the Slave Trade, there being the
greatest reason to believe, that where they
now export twenty shillings worth of commodities
thither, they would then export
an hundred pound; and I am inclined to
think when the trade comes to be extended
to the degree it will admit of, notwithstanding
those goods that are imported from
<em>Africa</em>, there will still be discovered an infinite
variety of trafficable articles, with which
the present Traders are totally unacquainted,
and this Trade become the most beneficial
to <em>Britain</em>, <em>America</em>, and the <em>West-Indies</em>,
of any that is at present on foot, as
it is common to every individual, and of
which the government has taken much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
notice, by granting an annual sum of ten
thousand pounds sterling for the maintaining
and upholding the forts and castles
in the <em>British</em> Settlements in <em>Africa</em>, so that
they are entirely defended against the attacks
of any enemy, and their Trade and
Colonies secured by irresistible strength of
forts and castles.</p>

<p>A great deal more could be mentioned
on the thousands of advantages that may
arise to the interest of <em>Britain</em> and the Plantations
in abolishing this wicked Trade:
However, I shall detain my Readers no
longer on this head, but as proposed,</p>

<p>Conclude the whole with some short
admonitions to those concerned, and a method
to put this Trade to <em>Africa</em> upon a
just and lawful footing. I advise every
Merchant and Ship-master who is in this
Trade of Man-slaving to renounce and
give it up. What arguments or reason,
pray, can be advanced for his justification,
when he sees such threats and curses against
him, particularly mentioned in the first
head? Why should any person incur the
penalties of <span class="smcap">God</span>’s Law so daringly for the
sake of gain? Should they think themselves
on a death-bed, what agonies and
troubles of mind must they undergo in the
thoughts of enslaving so many miserable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
creatures, of murdering so many thousands
of innocent people in the wars they occasion,
treacherously taking them out of their
own country, using them barbarously, massacring
numbers of them in all the cruel ways
imaginable on the passage, selling them
for life, and depriving them even of a comfortable
living, notwithstanding they serve
for nothing else; surely the judgment of
<span class="smcap">God</span> must come upon such men who will
thus use their own Brethren who were
born to inherit the same salvation with us,
and if his judgment does not come upon
them, it will pursue their children unto the
third and fourth generation, until the riches
that have been thus scandalously amassed
be squandered away, and they become as
poor as these Negroes themselves, by selling
of whom such unjust gain was made.
But this is only one way out of thousands
that <span class="smcap">God</span> chuses to afflict his enemies in
this world. And,</p>

<p>Still pursuing, that <span class="smcap">God</span> will be revenged
on those that punish wrongfully
such poor Negroes, I shall insert what
the above mentioned Mr. <em>George Whitefield</em>
says in a letter to the inhabitants
of <em>Virginia</em>, &amp;c. “We have,” says he,
“a remarkable instance of <span class="smcap">God</span>’s taking
cognizance of, and avenging the quarrel of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
poor Slaves, 2 <em>Sam.</em> xxi. 1. There was a
famine in the days of <em>David</em>, three years,
year after year, and <em>David</em> enquired of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> answered, it
is for <em>Saul</em>, and his bloody house, because
he slew the <em>Gibeonites</em>. Two things are
here very remarkable, 1st. These <em>Gibeonites</em>
were only hewers of wood and
drawers of water; or in other words,
Slaves like yours. 2d. That this plague
was sent by <span class="smcap">God</span> <em>many years after the injury</em>
(the cause of the plague) was committed.
And for what end were this and
such like examples recorded in holy
Scripture? Without doubt for our learning.
For <span class="smcap">God</span> is the same to-day as he
was yesterday, <ins class="corr" id="tn-56" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'and will coutinue'">
and will continue</ins> the same
for ever. He does not reject the prayer
of the poor and destitute, nor disregard
the cry of the meanest Negro.” When
speaking of the oppression and unchristian
usage these poor Negroes meet with from the
Ship-masters in their passage, and from the
Masters they are sold to in the south parts
of <em>America</em> and the <em>West-Indies</em>, he adds,
“The blood of the Negroes spilt for these
many years in your respective Provinces
will rise up to Heaven against you,” together
with that lost in <em>Africa</em>, occasioned by the
Traders that go thither. It may not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
be improper to observe here, that this
plague was sent by <span class="smcap">God</span> on <em>Saul</em> and
his bloody house <em>many years after the
slaughter of the</em> Gibeonites; so may these
men reasonably expect, that have occasioned
and still continue to be the cause of spilling
so much innocent blood in <em>Africa</em> and
the different Provinces, to have a plague or
curse come upon them, <em>many years after the
perpetrating these wicked deeds</em>.</p>

<p>I will insert a few questions, for which
I am indebted to Mr. <em>Postlethwayt</em>, by way
of argument or persuasion to give up this
enslaving of Men to those people who will
be ready to defend this scandalous Trade to
<em>Africa</em>, and of keeping these people in ignorance,
who are brought into a country
where the gospel is preached on all sides of
them.</p>

<p>1st. “Whether the people of this country
notwithstanding their colour, are not capable
of being civilized and brought into the
Christian religion, as well as great numbers
of the <em>Indians</em> of <em>America</em> and <em>Asia</em> have
been; and whether the primitive inhabitants
of all countries so far as we have been
able to trace them were not once as savage
and inhuman as the people in <em>Africa</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
and whether the ancient <em>Britons</em> themselves
of our country were not once upon a level
with the <em>Africans</em>?</p>

<p>2d. “Whether therefore, there is not
a probability that those people might in
time, by proper management in the <em>Europeans</em>,
become as wise, as industrious, as
humane, and as good Christians, as the
people of any other country?</p>

<p>3d. “Whether their rational faculties
are not in general equal to those of any
other of the human species; and whether
they are not, from experience, as capable
for mechanical and manufactural arts and
trades, as even the Bulk of the <em>Europeans</em>?</p>

<p>4th. “Whether it would not be more
to the interest of all the <em>European</em> Nations
concerned in the Trade to <em>Africa</em>, rather
to endeavour to cultivate a friendly and
humane Commerce with these people, into
the very centure of their extended country,
than to content themselves only with skimming
a trifling portion of Trade upon the
Coast of <em>Africa</em>?</p>

<p>5th. “Whether the greatest hinderance
and obstruction to the <em>European</em>’s cultivating
a Christian-like and humane Commerce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
with those populous countries has
not wholly proceeded from that unjust
Traffick called the Slave Trade, which is
carried on by the <em>Europeans</em> <em>Americans</em>,
<em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p>6th. “Whether this Trade and this only
was not the primary cause, and still continues
to be the chief cause of these eternal
and incessant broils, quarrels, and animosities
which subsist between the Negro
Princes and Chiefs; and consequently of
those endless wars which abide among
them, and which they are induced to carry
on in order to make prisoners of one another
for the sake of the Slave Trade?</p>

<p>7th. “Whether, if trade was carried on
with them for a series of years, as it has been
with most other savage countries, and the
<em>Europeans</em> gave no incouragement whatever
to the Slave Trade, those cruel wars among
the Blacks would not cease, and a fair and
honourable Commerce in time take place
throughout the whole country?</p>

<p>8th. “Whether the example of the
<em>Dutch</em> in the <em>East-Indies</em>, who have civilized
innumerable of the natives, and brought
them to the <em>European</em> way of cloathing, <em>&amp;c.</em>
does not give reasonable hopes that these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
suggestions are not visionary, but founded
on experience as well as on humane and
Christian principles?</p>

<p>9th. “Whether Commerce in general
has not proved the great means of civilizing
all nations, even the most savage and
brutal; and why not the <em>Africans</em>?</p>

<p>10th. “Whether the territory of the
<em>European</em> nations who are interested in the
Colonies and Plantations in <em>America</em>, are not
populous enough, or may be rendered so,
by proper encouragement given to matrimony
and the breed of foundling infants, to
supply their respective Colonies with labourers
in the place of Negro Slaves? And</p>

<p>Lastly. “Whether the <em>British</em> dominions
in general have not an extent of territory
sufficient to increase and multiply their inhabitants;
and whether it is not their own
faults that they do not increase them sufficiently
to supply their Colonies and Plantations,
with Whites instead of Blacks?”</p>

<p>I make no doubt, but some persons
who are concerned in the Slave Trade to
<em>Africa</em>, will attempt making answer to
some of these questions: But I presume
there are others of them they will not venture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
upon, knowing they are founded upon
reason and truth, and I hope will have great
influence on those this Treatise concern.</p>

<p>I would add one necessary query more,
to those who hold the sword of justice, and
who must account to God for the use they
make of it. Since the <em>English</em> Law is so
truly valuable for its justice, how can they
overlook the barbarous deaths and wrongful
Slavery of the unhappy <em>Africans</em>, without
trial or proof of being guilty of
crimes adequate to their punishments?
Why are those Masters of vessels (who
are not the most considerate of men) suffered
to be sovereign arbiters of the lives
of these miserable Negroes in their passage,
and allowed with impunity to destroy,
may I not say murder their fellow creatures
in a manner so cruel as can never be
related but with shame and horror? Answer
me this, ye pretended Judges and Governors
in the different Colonies where such practices
are used, and not be shocked at the
negligence you have sleeped in. Since you
are put in remembrance of it now, I hope
and sincerely wish, I, or any other person
may not have occasion to remind you of the
same again, but that you will punish with
equity all those who import Negroes;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
there being hundreds of poor <em>Europeans</em>
that would be glad to come and serve in
any of the <em>British</em> Plantations, and those that
could not pay a passage doubtless would sell
part of their time for it; and this I make
no doubt, considering they have not the
charge of their funeral and death-bed expences
and sundry other things to pay,
will come nigh if not full as cheap as
buying and keeping Negroes; and it will
be attended with this advantage, that these
White people when they have served some
years in the lowest capacities turn out upon
the waste land, marry, and in a few
years we see a town well settled, and in less
than fifty years there will be an increase of
fourfold; by this means the country will
fill up and we become respectable and secure
from an enemy, and furnished with
every conveniency of life. And you Governors,
<em>&amp;c.</em> who have the legislative power
in your hands will still further make
Laws and put them in execution, stopping
any further importation of Slaves into the
Provinces or Islands where you are the Representative
head, so that in that time they
may furnish themselves with sufficient numbers,
and by proper usage keep up that quantity
which so much decrease by improper
management. Now give me leave to proceed</p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>

<p>In a method to put this Trade to <em>Africa</em>
on a just and lawful footing. First, in
order to this, it is my humble opinion, if I
may be allowed to give it, that there be
a number of men who may chuse to venture
in this Trade, both in <em>Britain</em> and the Colonies,
that shall be incorporated into separate
bodies by the name of <em>English</em>, or <em>British</em>;
<em>American</em>, or <em>New-England African</em> companies,
or by the denomination of other Provinces
in <em>America</em>, or Plantations in the <em>West-Indies</em>;
and these companies shall equip and
rig out as many vessels as they think proper,
loading them with <em>British America</em>, <em>East</em>
and <em>West-India</em> goods, and bring back in
return, the rich and plentiful produce of <em>Africa</em>.
But before I go any further into this
point it must be observed, there is one real
hinderance in the way which must be removed,
or else no man or company need
ever think of penetrating into the heart
of this country, but just content themselves
with taking the skim of this Trade,
leting the body stand, and that is, the
Slave Trade; this must be entirely renounced
and given up by the <em>Europeans</em>, particularly
by <em>Britain</em> and the Colonies;
then we may with a good face and conscience<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
travel into the heart of <em>Africa</em>,
and meet with a friendly and hearty reception
from the natives, who will trade
with us, and give in exchange their valuable
productions for our goods which are
generally exported thither.</p>

<p>When that great, that only chief obstacle,
the Slave Trade is removed, then <em>Britain</em>
and the Colonies will flourish by so
great and profitable a Commerce. Think
what a great addition it will make to their
traffick, the furnishing a hundred thousand
people annually, more than are at present
with cloathing, powder, shot, and warlike
arms, and many more things needless here
to enumerate out of England; rum, and
sundry other articles out of <em>America</em> and the
<em>West-Indies</em>. It is supposed that the above extraordinary
number of Blacks are taken out
of <em>Africa</em> yearly, and either murdered or
made Slaves of, by the ships that go there
out of <em>Boston</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em> and what advantages may
arise to the inhabitants in peopling, and consequently
of cultivating and manuring their
ground, and of bringing their rich trade to
the perfection it is capable of, with <em>Britain</em>,
<em>&amp;c.</em> is hard to say, when the innermost parts
of that great and fruitful country is settled,
and a free and happy trade carried into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
heart of it: But thus far I will venture
to say, as I have done already, that where
twenty shillings worth of commodities is
at present exported an hundred pound will
be, when a friendly Commerce is carried
on with the natives.</p>

<p>These companies may say, that if once
this trade is set on foot, other <em>European</em> powers,
who have Settlements in <em>Africa</em> will
invade them whenever they begin to thrive
by not having sufficient funds for the keeping
in good defence the forts, &amp;c. on
the Settlements. As to this I answer, that
those companies have a sum of ten thousand
pounds sterling annually, from the
Crown of <em>Britain</em>, for maintaining and upholding
the forts and castles that are built
upon the <em>British</em> Colonies, which with
the duties arising from the Trade will be
sufficient to maintain, uphold, and defend
them with strength superior to the strongest
enemy.</p>

<p>Thus far I hope I have removed your
fears of inability in supporting and continuing
this Trade, and likewise have moved
ways and means to put the same on a
just and lawful footing. Now let me,
patient Reader, conclude with a short Exhortation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
to the Ship-masters and Merchants
concerned in this Trade, in part
of which I have had recourse again to
my good old Friend Mr. <em>Benezet</em>.</p>

<p>I beg you all would fly from the
oppression and Bondage to which the poor
<em>Africans</em> are subjected, loose the bonds
from off their necks, and thereby extricate
yourselves from a custom which is pernicious
to your welfare here and hereafter;
and as you are sensible most men have objections
to this base, unlawful Trade, you
ought to vindicate yourselves to the world,
upon principles of reason, honesty, and humanity,
and then you will not attack the
persons, or invade the rights of these people.
I believe those who are concerned in this
Trade will be at a loss to make this justification
but upon motives so weak and unreasonable,
that I do not think any of
them which have been advanced for their
defence worthy of notice; and if they are undeserving
of that, they certainly are below
regard; therefore I think <em>you should forever
lay it aside</em>. This is the best and shortest
way; for <em>there should be no trade carried
on</em>, it being a national and provincial concern,
<em>but such as is justifiable both to</em> <span class="smcap">God</span>
<em>and man</em>, and this is in direct opposition to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
both. But laying man’s resentment aside,
which is of little moment in comparison
with that of the Almighty’s, I counsel
you once more to think of a future reckoning,
consider what reasons you will be
able to produce at the great and last day.
You now accumulate riches and live in
pleasure; but what will you do in the
end, and that will be but short? What
if you should be called hence and hurried
out of this world under the vast load of
blood guiltiness that is now lying on your
souls? How many thousands have you
been <ins class="corr" id="tn-67" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'the istruments to'">
the instruments to</ins>, and primary cause
of being killed in the wars and broils with
the <em>African</em> Chiefs, wanting to obtain your
number to enslave; and how many have
you killed in the passage, when these poor
Creatures were trying to retrieve their Liberty
which they had in their own country,
and which you unjustly take from
them, or rather chusing to die than take
food to nourish and preserve themselves for
being mancipated with their children after
them?</p>

<p>It is declared in the most express terms in
Scripture, that thieves and murderers shall
not inherit the kingdom of <span class="smcap">God</span>. You
who are in this Trade take warning by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
that, and if you have any thoughts or
Christian feeling you must certainly renounce
it; for that you are thieves and
murderers (I hope after what has been said)
will not be disputed; and you should think
that at the same time and by the same
means you are treasuring up worldly riches,
you are treasuring up fountains of wrath
against the day of anger and vengeance that
shall come upon the workers of iniquity,
unless timely repented of.</p>

<p>What injustice is greater? What offence
more heinous? Is there any carries
in it more consummate guilt than that in
which you now live? How can you lift
your culpable eyes to Heaven? How
can you pray for mercy, or hope for savour
from him that made and formed you, while
you go on thus boldly and publickly dishonouring
him, in degrading and destroying
the noblest workmanship of his hands
in this sublunary world? Can you think
that <span class="smcap">God</span> will hear your prayers, receive
your supplications, or grant your desires,
while you act thus grossly and openly
against his divine revealed will and pleasure?
And do you suppose that he who is
the Parent of all nations, the Protector of
all people, and the Father of all men, will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
not revenge <ins class="corr" id="tn-69" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'the male-treatment of'">
the mal-treatment of</ins> his offspring
whom he once so loved as to give
his only begotten Son, <em>that whosoever believed
in him should not perish, but have everlasting
life</em>? This love of <span class="smcap">God</span> to man,
which is disclosed in Scripture, adds double
provocation to your crimes; for if <span class="smcap">God</span>
regards us with so much affection, we
ought also to esteem one another.</p>

<p>Permit yourselves for a moment to reflect
equitably and deliberately upon the
nature of this horrid, detestable, vile, and
abominable Man Trade, and your hearts
must certainly relent, if you have not lost
all sense of benevolence, all sympathy and
compassion towards those of your Brethren
who have the same capacities, understandings
and souls, and who were born to inherit
the same salvation with you; I say,
if you are not callous to every Christian, humane,
and manly sensibility, you certainly
must feel compassion for those extremely
oppressed people, when you think what
miseries, what devastations and massacres
among them you have been the author of,
and all for filthy lucre’s sake. The
thoughts of this accursed Trade touches
my very heart, and finding if I continue any
longer I shall get out of the bounds of decency,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
must therefore conclude. And if all
you have read should have no weight upon
<ins class="corr" id="tn-70" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'your hardned hearts'">
your hardened hearts</ins>, this remains for my
consolation that I have done my duty; and
I pray! Fervently pray! That <span class="smcap">God</span> would
have mercy on your sinful souls; and that
he of his infinite goodness would grant that
you may be made sensible of your guilt and
repent of these your execrable and really
detestable deeds.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> It is supposed eighty thousand Negroes, are upon the
Island of <em>Barbadoes</em>, and yet through the hard labour they
exact of these poor creatures, and what of them are killed
through their barbarous chastisements, a decrease is made of
five thousand Slaves yearly, which they are resupplied with
from <em>Africa</em>; and it may be reasonably expected, that
the children eighty thousand Negroes would have, were
they worked in the same manner with the white people, and
did not so many of them die through hard labour, and
from the treatment they suffer: I say, it may be expected,
there would be an increase of ten thousand at a moderate
computation yearly, instead of five thousand decreasing.
One may form an idea from this, of what an additional
supply most of the <em>West-India</em> Islands and Southern
Provinces need, for there is not one of them but what
import a considerable number of Slaves annually, to
keep up their common stock.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
